    "explanation": "The given scenario is suggestive of the development of resistance to imatinib, which is a tyrosine \nkinase inhibitor. This condition arises due to point mutations in three separate regions of the \nkinase domain. The contact points between imatinib and the enzyme become sites of mutations in drug-resistant \nleukemic cells and hence these mutations prevent tight binding of the drug and lock the enzyme in \nits open configuration (the configuration in which it has access to the substrate and is \nenzymatically active). Mechanisms other than BCR-ABL kinase mutations play a minor role in resistance to imatinib. \nThey include: • Amplification of the wild-type kinase gene has been identified in some cases. • Overexpression of MDR-gene leading to increased drug efflux transporter has been shown \nexperimentally but not implicated in clinical resistance. Nilotinib retains inhibitory activity in the presence of most point mutations that confer resistance \nto imatinib.",

This condition arises due to point mutations in three separate regions of the \nkinase domain. The contact points between imatinib and the enzyme become sites of mutations in drug-resistant \nleukemic cells and hence these mutations prevent tight binding of the drug and lock the enzyme in \nits open configuration (the configuration in which it has access to the substrate and is \nenzymatically active). Mechanisms other than BCR-ABL kinase mutations play a minor role in resistance to imatinib. \nThey include: • Amplification of the wild-type kinase gene has been identified in some cases. • Overexpression of MDR-gene leading to increased drug efflux transporter has been shown \nexperimentally but not implicated in clinical resistance.

Mechanisms other than BCR-ABL kinase mutations play a minor role in resistance to imatinib. \nThey include: • Amplification of the wild-type kinase gene has been identified in some cases. • Overexpression of MDR-gene leading to increased drug efflux transporter has been shown \nexperimentally but not implicated in clinical resistance.

Mechanisms other than BCR-ABL kinase mutations play a minor role in resistance to imatinib. \nThey include: • Amplification of the wild-type kinase gene has been identified in some cases. • Overexpression of MDR-gene leading to increased drug efflux transporter has been shown \nexperimentally but not implicated in clinical resistance.

Mechanisms other than BCR-ABL kinase mutations play a minor role in resistance to imatinib. \nThey include: • Amplification of the wild-type kinase gene has been identified in some cases. • Overexpression of MDR-gene leading to increased drug efflux transporter has been shown \nexperimentally but not implicated in clinical resistance.

Sipuleucel-T preparation is done by isolating a patient's peripheral blood cells by leukapheresis \nand then exposing them to PAP-GM-CSF (which is a human recombinant protein). When these \ntreated cells are infused to a patient, the APCs present in the blood produces antibodies directed \nagainst PAP.

Option D: Vitamin K1 is the specific antidote for warfarin-induced bleeding, but it takes 6-24 \nhours for the clotting factors to be resynthesized and released in blood after Vitamin K \nadministration and hence its action is delayed for several hours. Option A: Cryoprecipitate mainly contains factor VIII and fibrinogen and therefore is not suitable \nfor warfarin-induced bleeding, as warfarin inhibits factors II, VII, IX, X. 780 \nSold by @itachibot Option B: Fresh frozen plasma can also be used but prothrombin complex concentrate normalizes \nthe INR more rapidly.",

Mechanisms other than BCR-ABL kinase mutations play a minor role in resistance to imatinib. \nThey include: • Amplification of the wild-type kinase gene has been identified in some cases. • Overexpression of MDR-gene leading to increased drug efflux transporter has been shown \nexperimentally but not implicated in clinical resistance.
