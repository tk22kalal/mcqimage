    "explanation": "The wobble hypothesis explains the degeneracy of the genetic code. The wobble hypothesis states that codon-anticodon pairing follows the traditional Watson–Crick \nrules (G pairs with C and A pairs with U) for the first two bases of the codon but can be less \nstringent for the third/last base. It has been observed that a tRNA can recognize more than one \ncodon for a specific amino acid, especially in the last nucleotide of the codon triplet. This is \nreferred to as degeneracy and its mechanism can be explained by the wobble hypothesis. The first base of the anticodon moves to permit nontraditional pairing with the last base of the \ncodon. This movement is called wobble and is possible because the first base of the anticodon is \nnot as spatially defined as the other two bases. Due to the wobbling, 6‰ tRNA species are not \nrequired to read the 6‰ codons. For example, three codons for glycine—GGU, GGC, and GGA—can form a base pair from one \nanticodon, 3 CCI 5 ie, I, inosine, can base pair with U, C, and A, as shown in the diagram below. Other options: Option A: The genetic code is universal because it is the same for all living organisms. 449 \nSold by @itachibot Option B: The genetic code is unambiguous because each codon is specific for only one amino \nacid. Example: GGA only codes for Glycine. Option D: The genetic code is non-punctuated. This means that once the reading commences at a \nspecific start codon, it is continuous and is read continuously as triplets until a stop codon is \nreached without stopping. 450 \nSold by @itachibot",

    "explanation": "The false statement is that telomerase is involved in DNA repair. Telomeres are the end of chromosomal DNA. Since prokaryotic DNA is circular, it does not have \nfree ends and hence no telomeres. Thus, telomeres are present only in eukaryotes Telomeres have \nTG- rich repeats and usually do not code for any proteins. With every DNA replication during cell \ndivision, telomere shortening occurs. Once telomeres are almost negligible or non-existent in \nlength, the DNA is unable to replicate and the cell dies. Hence, there is a limit to the number of \ntimes a cell can divide. In stem cells and cancer cells, an enzyme telomerase having reverse transcriptase activity (RNA \ndependent DNA polymerase) adds telomeres to the chromosome ends, thereby preserving \nchromosomal length. It allows the stem cells and cancer cells to multiply a lot more number of \ntimes than a normal adult cell. 403 \nSold by @itachibot RNA synthesis, processing and modification",

The wobble hypothesis states that codon-anticodon pairing follows the traditional Watson–Crick \nrules (G pairs with C and A pairs with U) for the first two bases of the codon but can be less \nstringent for the third/last base. It has been observed that a tRNA can recognize more than one \ncodon for a specific amino acid, especially in the last nucleotide of the codon triplet. This is \nreferred to as degeneracy and its mechanism can be explained by the wobble hypothesis. The first base of the anticodon moves to permit nontraditional pairing with the last base of the \ncodon. This movement is called wobble and is possible because the first base of the anticodon is \nnot as spatially defined as the other two bases. Due to the wobbling, 6‰ tRNA species are not \nrequired to read the 6‰ codons. For example, three codons for glycine—GGU, GGC, and GGA—can form a base pair from one \nanticodon, 3 CCI 5 ie, I, inosine, can base pair with U, C, and A, as shown in the diagram below. Other options: Option A: The genetic code is universal because it is the same for all living organisms. 449 \nSold by @itachibot Option B: The genetic code is unambiguous because each codon is specific for only one amino \nacid.
