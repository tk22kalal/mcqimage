Regulation of respiration in exercise • During strenuous exercise, O2 consumption and CO2 for mation can increase as much as 20- \nfold. Yet in the healthy athlete, the arterial PO2, PCO2, and pH remain almost exactly \nnormal. This is because the alveolar ventilation increases along with the increased level of oxygen \nmetabolism. • Part of this stimulation of alveolar ventilation results from direct stimulation of the respiratory \ncenter by nervous signals. An additional part is believed to result from sensory signals transmitted \ninto the respiratory center from the contracting muscles and joint proprioceptors. • During strenuous exercise, the utilization of O2 in the entire body can increase to 75% to 85%. \nSo, essentially all the oxygen is given to the exercising muscles leading to an increased 811 \nSold by @itachibot arterio-venous difference in oxygen concentration.",

    "explanation": "The fall in blood bicarbonate levels is compensatory, and it helps increase the exercise effort, not \nhinder it. Adaptation at High Altitudes The work capacity is reduced at high altitudes and this reduction is in direct proportion to the \ndecrease in O2 uptake. (Option B) Immediate exposure to low PO2 at higher altitudes stimulates the arterial chemoreceptors, and \nthis stimulation increases alveolar ventilation. This immediate increase in pulmonary ventilation upon rising to a high altitude blows off large \nquantities of CO2, reducing the PCO2 and increasing the pH of the body fluids (Respiratory \nalkalosis). This raised pH inhibits the brain stem respiratory center and opposes the increased \nventilation. So, respiratory alkalosis will hinder the maximal exercise effort. (Option C). To compensate for this respiratory alkalosis, kidneys reduce hydrogen ion secretion and increase \nbicarbonate excretion. This reduces plasma and cerebrospinal fluid bicarbonate concentration and \nbrings the pH towards normal. This removes the inhibitory effect of alkalosis on respiration. \nHence the fall in blood bicarbonate facilitates the exercise effort. NOTE Lactic acid causes extreme fatigue. (Option D) Ordinarily, the pyruvic acid from glycolysis enters the mitochondria of muscle cells and reacts \nwith oxygen to form many ATP molecules. However, when there is insufficient oxygen (at high altitudes), most of the pyruvic acid then is \nconverted into lactic acid, which diffuses out of the muscle cells into the interstitial fluid and \nblood. 812 \nSold by @itachibot",

Effect of Smoking on Pulmonary Ventilation in Exercise • Nicotine causes constriction of the terminal bronchioles of the lungs, which increases the \nresistance of air flow into and out of the lungs. • The irritating effects of the smoke causes increased fluid secretion into the bronchial tree and \nsome degree of swelling of the epithelial linings, which again increases airflow resistance. • Nicotine paralyzes the cilia on the surfaces of the respiratory epithelial cells. As a result, much \ndebris accumulates in the passageways, and this adds further to the difficulty in breathing. • All these factors together make even a light smoker experience respiratory strain during maximal \nexercise, and their level of performance may be reduced. • In persons with severe emphysema, as much as four-fifths of the respiratory membrane can be \ndestroyed; then, even the slightest exercise can cause respiratory distress.

This is because the alveolar ventilation increases along with the increased level of oxygen \nmetabolism. • Part of this stimulation of alveolar ventilation results from direct stimulation of the respiratory \ncenter by nervous signals.

    "explanation": "The fall in blood bicarbonate levels is compensatory, and it helps increase the exercise effort, not \nhinder it. Adaptation at High Altitudes The work capacity is reduced at high altitudes and this reduction is in direct proportion to the \ndecrease in O2 uptake. (Option B) Immediate exposure to low PO2 at higher altitudes stimulates the arterial chemoreceptors, and \nthis stimulation increases alveolar ventilation. This immediate increase in pulmonary ventilation upon rising to a high altitude blows off large \nquantities of CO2, reducing the PCO2 and increasing the pH of the body fluids (Respiratory \nalkalosis). This raised pH inhibits the brain stem respiratory center and opposes the increased \nventilation. So, respiratory alkalosis will hinder the maximal exercise effort. (Option C). To compensate for this respiratory alkalosis, kidneys reduce hydrogen ion secretion and increase \nbicarbonate excretion. This reduces plasma and cerebrospinal fluid bicarbonate concentration and \nbrings the pH towards normal. This removes the inhibitory effect of alkalosis on respiration. \nHence the fall in blood bicarbonate facilitates the exercise effort. NOTE Lactic acid causes extreme fatigue. (Option D) Ordinarily, the pyruvic acid from glycolysis enters the mitochondria of muscle cells and reacts \nwith oxygen to form many ATP molecules. However, when there is insufficient oxygen (at high altitudes), most of the pyruvic acid then is \nconverted into lactic acid, which diffuses out of the muscle cells into the interstitial fluid and \nblood. 812 \nSold by @itachibot",

This is because the alveolar ventilation increases along with the increased level of oxygen \nmetabolism. • Part of this stimulation of alveolar ventilation results from direct stimulation of the respiratory \ncenter by nervous signals.

    "explanation": "The fall in blood bicarbonate levels is compensatory, and it helps increase the exercise effort, not \nhinder it. Adaptation at High Altitudes The work capacity is reduced at high altitudes and this reduction is in direct proportion to the \ndecrease in O2 uptake. (Option B) Immediate exposure to low PO2 at higher altitudes stimulates the arterial chemoreceptors, and \nthis stimulation increases alveolar ventilation. This immediate increase in pulmonary ventilation upon rising to a high altitude blows off large \nquantities of CO2, reducing the PCO2 and increasing the pH of the body fluids (Respiratory \nalkalosis). This raised pH inhibits the brain stem respiratory center and opposes the increased \nventilation. So, respiratory alkalosis will hinder the maximal exercise effort. (Option C). To compensate for this respiratory alkalosis, kidneys reduce hydrogen ion secretion and increase \nbicarbonate excretion. This reduces plasma and cerebrospinal fluid bicarbonate concentration and \nbrings the pH towards normal. This removes the inhibitory effect of alkalosis on respiration. \nHence the fall in blood bicarbonate facilitates the exercise effort. NOTE Lactic acid causes extreme fatigue. (Option D) Ordinarily, the pyruvic acid from glycolysis enters the mitochondria of muscle cells and reacts \nwith oxygen to form many ATP molecules. However, when there is insufficient oxygen (at high altitudes), most of the pyruvic acid then is \nconverted into lactic acid, which diffuses out of the muscle cells into the interstitial fluid and \nblood. 812 \nSold by @itachibot",

As a result, much \ndebris accumulates in the passageways, and this adds further to the difficulty in breathing. • All these factors together make even a light smoker experience respiratory strain during maximal \nexercise, and their level of performance may be reduced. • In persons with severe emphysema, as much as four-fifths of the respiratory membrane can be \ndestroyed; then, even the slightest exercise can cause respiratory distress.

Regulation of respiration in exercise • During strenuous exercise, O2 consumption and CO2 for mation can increase as much as 20- \nfold. Yet in the healthy athlete, the arterial PO2, PCO2, and pH remain almost exactly \nnormal. This is because the alveolar ventilation increases along with the increased level of oxygen \nmetabolism. • Part of this stimulation of alveolar ventilation results from direct stimulation of the respiratory \ncenter by nervous signals. An additional part is believed to result from sensory signals transmitted \ninto the respiratory center from the contracting muscles and joint proprioceptors. • During strenuous exercise, the utilization of O2 in the entire body can increase to 75% to 85%. \nSo, essentially all the oxygen is given to the exercising muscles leading to an increased 811 \nSold by @itachibot arterio-venous difference in oxygen concentration.",

    "explanation": "The fall in blood bicarbonate levels is compensatory, and it helps increase the exercise effort, not \nhinder it. Adaptation at High Altitudes The work capacity is reduced at high altitudes and this reduction is in direct proportion to the \ndecrease in O2 uptake. (Option B) Immediate exposure to low PO2 at higher altitudes stimulates the arterial chemoreceptors, and \nthis stimulation increases alveolar ventilation. This immediate increase in pulmonary ventilation upon rising to a high altitude blows off large \nquantities of CO2, reducing the PCO2 and increasing the pH of the body fluids (Respiratory \nalkalosis). This raised pH inhibits the brain stem respiratory center and opposes the increased \nventilation. So, respiratory alkalosis will hinder the maximal exercise effort. (Option C). To compensate for this respiratory alkalosis, kidneys reduce hydrogen ion secretion and increase \nbicarbonate excretion. This reduces plasma and cerebrospinal fluid bicarbonate concentration and \nbrings the pH towards normal. This removes the inhibitory effect of alkalosis on respiration. \nHence the fall in blood bicarbonate facilitates the exercise effort. NOTE Lactic acid causes extreme fatigue. (Option D) Ordinarily, the pyruvic acid from glycolysis enters the mitochondria of muscle cells and reacts \nwith oxygen to form many ATP molecules. However, when there is insufficient oxygen (at high altitudes), most of the pyruvic acid then is \nconverted into lactic acid, which diffuses out of the muscle cells into the interstitial fluid and \nblood. 812 \nSold by @itachibot",

As a result, much \ndebris accumulates in the passageways, and this adds further to the difficulty in breathing. • All these factors together make even a light smoker experience respiratory strain during maximal \nexercise, and their level of performance may be reduced. • In persons with severe emphysema, as much as four-fifths of the respiratory membrane can be \ndestroyed; then, even the slightest exercise can cause respiratory distress.

Regulation of respiration in exercise • During strenuous exercise, O2 consumption and CO2 for mation can increase as much as 20- \nfold. Yet in the healthy athlete, the arterial PO2, PCO2, and pH remain almost exactly \nnormal. This is because the alveolar ventilation increases along with the increased level of oxygen \nmetabolism. • Part of this stimulation of alveolar ventilation results from direct stimulation of the respiratory \ncenter by nervous signals. An additional part is believed to result from sensory signals transmitted \ninto the respiratory center from the contracting muscles and joint proprioceptors. • During strenuous exercise, the utilization of O2 in the entire body can increase to 75% to 85%. \nSo, essentially all the oxygen is given to the exercising muscles leading to an increased 811 \nSold by @itachibot arterio-venous difference in oxygen concentration.",

    "explanation": "The fall in blood bicarbonate levels is compensatory, and it helps increase the exercise effort, not \nhinder it. Adaptation at High Altitudes The work capacity is reduced at high altitudes and this reduction is in direct proportion to the \ndecrease in O2 uptake. (Option B) Immediate exposure to low PO2 at higher altitudes stimulates the arterial chemoreceptors, and \nthis stimulation increases alveolar ventilation. This immediate increase in pulmonary ventilation upon rising to a high altitude blows off large \nquantities of CO2, reducing the PCO2 and increasing the pH of the body fluids (Respiratory \nalkalosis). This raised pH inhibits the brain stem respiratory center and opposes the increased \nventilation. So, respiratory alkalosis will hinder the maximal exercise effort. (Option C). To compensate for this respiratory alkalosis, kidneys reduce hydrogen ion secretion and increase \nbicarbonate excretion. This reduces plasma and cerebrospinal fluid bicarbonate concentration and \nbrings the pH towards normal. This removes the inhibitory effect of alkalosis on respiration. \nHence the fall in blood bicarbonate facilitates the exercise effort. NOTE Lactic acid causes extreme fatigue. (Option D) Ordinarily, the pyruvic acid from glycolysis enters the mitochondria of muscle cells and reacts \nwith oxygen to form many ATP molecules. However, when there is insufficient oxygen (at high altitudes), most of the pyruvic acid then is \nconverted into lactic acid, which diffuses out of the muscle cells into the interstitial fluid and \nblood. 812 \nSold by @itachibot",

As a result, much \ndebris accumulates in the passageways, and this adds further to the difficulty in breathing. • All these factors together make even a light smoker experience respiratory strain during maximal \nexercise, and their level of performance may be reduced. • In persons with severe emphysema, as much as four-fifths of the respiratory membrane can be \ndestroyed; then, even the slightest exercise can cause respiratory distress.

This is because the alveolar ventilation increases along with the increased level of oxygen \nmetabolism. • Part of this stimulation of alveolar ventilation results from direct stimulation of the respiratory \ncenter by nervous signals.

    "explanation": "The fall in blood bicarbonate levels is compensatory, and it helps increase the exercise effort, not \nhinder it. Adaptation at High Altitudes The work capacity is reduced at high altitudes and this reduction is in direct proportion to the \ndecrease in O2 uptake. (Option B) Immediate exposure to low PO2 at higher altitudes stimulates the arterial chemoreceptors, and \nthis stimulation increases alveolar ventilation. This immediate increase in pulmonary ventilation upon rising to a high altitude blows off large \nquantities of CO2, reducing the PCO2 and increasing the pH of the body fluids (Respiratory \nalkalosis). This raised pH inhibits the brain stem respiratory center and opposes the increased \nventilation. So, respiratory alkalosis will hinder the maximal exercise effort. (Option C). To compensate for this respiratory alkalosis, kidneys reduce hydrogen ion secretion and increase \nbicarbonate excretion. This reduces plasma and cerebrospinal fluid bicarbonate concentration and \nbrings the pH towards normal. This removes the inhibitory effect of alkalosis on respiration. \nHence the fall in blood bicarbonate facilitates the exercise effort. NOTE Lactic acid causes extreme fatigue. (Option D) Ordinarily, the pyruvic acid from glycolysis enters the mitochondria of muscle cells and reacts \nwith oxygen to form many ATP molecules. However, when there is insufficient oxygen (at high altitudes), most of the pyruvic acid then is \nconverted into lactic acid, which diffuses out of the muscle cells into the interstitial fluid and \nblood. 812 \nSold by @itachibot",

Regulation of respiration in exercise • During strenuous exercise, O2 consumption and CO2 for mation can increase as much as 20- \nfold. Yet in the healthy athlete, the arterial PO2, PCO2, and pH remain almost exactly \nnormal. This is because the alveolar ventilation increases along with the increased level of oxygen \nmetabolism. • Part of this stimulation of alveolar ventilation results from direct stimulation of the respiratory \ncenter by nervous signals. An additional part is believed to result from sensory signals transmitted \ninto the respiratory center from the contracting muscles and joint proprioceptors. • During strenuous exercise, the utilization of O2 in the entire body can increase to 75% to 85%. \nSo, essentially all the oxygen is given to the exercising muscles leading to an increased 811 \nSold by @itachibot arterio-venous difference in oxygen concentration.",

    "explanation": "The fall in blood bicarbonate levels is compensatory, and it helps increase the exercise effort, not \nhinder it. Adaptation at High Altitudes The work capacity is reduced at high altitudes and this reduction is in direct proportion to the \ndecrease in O2 uptake. (Option B) Immediate exposure to low PO2 at higher altitudes stimulates the arterial chemoreceptors, and \nthis stimulation increases alveolar ventilation. This immediate increase in pulmonary ventilation upon rising to a high altitude blows off large \nquantities of CO2, reducing the PCO2 and increasing the pH of the body fluids (Respiratory \nalkalosis). This raised pH inhibits the brain stem respiratory center and opposes the increased \nventilation. So, respiratory alkalosis will hinder the maximal exercise effort. (Option C). To compensate for this respiratory alkalosis, kidneys reduce hydrogen ion secretion and increase \nbicarbonate excretion. This reduces plasma and cerebrospinal fluid bicarbonate concentration and \nbrings the pH towards normal. This removes the inhibitory effect of alkalosis on respiration. \nHence the fall in blood bicarbonate facilitates the exercise effort. NOTE Lactic acid causes extreme fatigue. (Option D) Ordinarily, the pyruvic acid from glycolysis enters the mitochondria of muscle cells and reacts \nwith oxygen to form many ATP molecules. However, when there is insufficient oxygen (at high altitudes), most of the pyruvic acid then is \nconverted into lactic acid, which diffuses out of the muscle cells into the interstitial fluid and \nblood. 812 \nSold by @itachibot",

As a result, much \ndebris accumulates in the passageways, and this adds further to the difficulty in breathing. • All these factors together make even a light smoker experience respiratory strain during maximal \nexercise, and their level of performance may be reduced. • In persons with severe emphysema, as much as four-fifths of the respiratory membrane can be \ndestroyed; then, even the slightest exercise can cause respiratory distress.

    "explanation": "The fall in blood bicarbonate levels is compensatory, and it helps increase the exercise effort, not \nhinder it. Adaptation at High Altitudes The work capacity is reduced at high altitudes and this reduction is in direct proportion to the \ndecrease in O2 uptake. (Option B) Immediate exposure to low PO2 at higher altitudes stimulates the arterial chemoreceptors, and \nthis stimulation increases alveolar ventilation. This immediate increase in pulmonary ventilation upon rising to a high altitude blows off large \nquantities of CO2, reducing the PCO2 and increasing the pH of the body fluids (Respiratory \nalkalosis). This raised pH inhibits the brain stem respiratory center and opposes the increased \nventilation. So, respiratory alkalosis will hinder the maximal exercise effort. (Option C). To compensate for this respiratory alkalosis, kidneys reduce hydrogen ion secretion and increase \nbicarbonate excretion. This reduces plasma and cerebrospinal fluid bicarbonate concentration and \nbrings the pH towards normal. This removes the inhibitory effect of alkalosis on respiration. \nHence the fall in blood bicarbonate facilitates the exercise effort. NOTE Lactic acid causes extreme fatigue. (Option D) Ordinarily, the pyruvic acid from glycolysis enters the mitochondria of muscle cells and reacts \nwith oxygen to form many ATP molecules. However, when there is insufficient oxygen (at high altitudes), most of the pyruvic acid then is \nconverted into lactic acid, which diffuses out of the muscle cells into the interstitial fluid and \nblood. 812 \nSold by @itachibot",

As a result, much \ndebris accumulates in the passageways, and this adds further to the difficulty in breathing. • All these factors together make even a light smoker experience respiratory strain during maximal \nexercise, and their level of performance may be reduced. • In persons with severe emphysema, as much as four-fifths of the respiratory membrane can be \ndestroyed; then, even the slightest exercise can cause respiratory distress.

This is because the alveolar ventilation increases along with the increased level of oxygen \nmetabolism. • Part of this stimulation of alveolar ventilation results from direct stimulation of the respiratory \ncenter by nervous signals. An additional part is believed to result from sensory signals transmitted \ninto the respiratory center from the contracting muscles and joint proprioceptors. • During strenuous exercise, the utilization of O2 in the entire body can increase to 75% to 85%. \nSo, essentially all the oxygen is given to the exercising muscles leading to an increased 811 \nSold by @itachibot arterio-venous difference in oxygen concentration.",

    "explanation": "The fall in blood bicarbonate levels is compensatory, and it helps increase the exercise effort, not \nhinder it. Adaptation at High Altitudes The work capacity is reduced at high altitudes and this reduction is in direct proportion to the \ndecrease in O2 uptake. (Option B) Immediate exposure to low PO2 at higher altitudes stimulates the arterial chemoreceptors, and \nthis stimulation increases alveolar ventilation. This immediate increase in pulmonary ventilation upon rising to a high altitude blows off large \nquantities of CO2, reducing the PCO2 and increasing the pH of the body fluids (Respiratory \nalkalosis). This raised pH inhibits the brain stem respiratory center and opposes the increased \nventilation. So, respiratory alkalosis will hinder the maximal exercise effort. (Option C). To compensate for this respiratory alkalosis, kidneys reduce hydrogen ion secretion and increase \nbicarbonate excretion. This reduces plasma and cerebrospinal fluid bicarbonate concentration and \nbrings the pH towards normal. This removes the inhibitory effect of alkalosis on respiration. \nHence the fall in blood bicarbonate facilitates the exercise effort. NOTE Lactic acid causes extreme fatigue. (Option D) Ordinarily, the pyruvic acid from glycolysis enters the mitochondria of muscle cells and reacts \nwith oxygen to form many ATP molecules. However, when there is insufficient oxygen (at high altitudes), most of the pyruvic acid then is \nconverted into lactic acid, which diffuses out of the muscle cells into the interstitial fluid and \nblood. 812 \nSold by @itachibot",

This is because the alveolar ventilation increases along with the increased level of oxygen \nmetabolism. • Part of this stimulation of alveolar ventilation results from direct stimulation of the respiratory \ncenter by nervous signals.

    "explanation": "The fall in blood bicarbonate levels is compensatory, and it helps increase the exercise effort, not \nhinder it. Adaptation at High Altitudes The work capacity is reduced at high altitudes and this reduction is in direct proportion to the \ndecrease in O2 uptake. (Option B) Immediate exposure to low PO2 at higher altitudes stimulates the arterial chemoreceptors, and \nthis stimulation increases alveolar ventilation. This immediate increase in pulmonary ventilation upon rising to a high altitude blows off large \nquantities of CO2, reducing the PCO2 and increasing the pH of the body fluids (Respiratory \nalkalosis). This raised pH inhibits the brain stem respiratory center and opposes the increased \nventilation. So, respiratory alkalosis will hinder the maximal exercise effort. (Option C). To compensate for this respiratory alkalosis, kidneys reduce hydrogen ion secretion and increase \nbicarbonate excretion. This reduces plasma and cerebrospinal fluid bicarbonate concentration and \nbrings the pH towards normal. This removes the inhibitory effect of alkalosis on respiration. \nHence the fall in blood bicarbonate facilitates the exercise effort. NOTE Lactic acid causes extreme fatigue. (Option D) Ordinarily, the pyruvic acid from glycolysis enters the mitochondria of muscle cells and reacts \nwith oxygen to form many ATP molecules. However, when there is insufficient oxygen (at high altitudes), most of the pyruvic acid then is \nconverted into lactic acid, which diffuses out of the muscle cells into the interstitial fluid and \nblood. 812 \nSold by @itachibot",

Cardiovascular Changes in Exercise • The maximum increase of cardiac output is 4-fold that can commonly be achieved by the \nuntrained runner and 7-fold that can be achieved in some marathon runners. • The increase in heart rate accounts for a greater proportion of the increase in cardiac output \nthan the increase in stroke volume during sustained strenuous exercise. • Exercise also causes an increased venous return due to • Increased activity of the respiratory pump • Increased activity of the muscular pump • Increased venous tone due to sympathetic stimulation • Increased blood flow from arteries to veins • In severe exercise, there is increased systolic and mean blood pressure due to • vasoconstriction of the arterioles and small arteries in most tissues of the body • increased pumping activity by the heart • a great increase in mean systemic filling pressure caused mainly by venous contraction. 815 \nSold by @itachibot • As seen in the figure, point A is the resting cardiac output. On exercise, there is a rise in the \nmean systemic filling pressure shown on the X-axis. • The venous return also rises which causes the cardiac output to reach point B, which is 4 times \nthe normal resting cardiac output.",

    "explanation": "The fall in blood bicarbonate levels is compensatory, and it helps increase the exercise effort, not \nhinder it. Adaptation at High Altitudes The work capacity is reduced at high altitudes and this reduction is in direct proportion to the \ndecrease in O2 uptake. (Option B) Immediate exposure to low PO2 at higher altitudes stimulates the arterial chemoreceptors, and \nthis stimulation increases alveolar ventilation. This immediate increase in pulmonary ventilation upon rising to a high altitude blows off large \nquantities of CO2, reducing the PCO2 and increasing the pH of the body fluids (Respiratory \nalkalosis). This raised pH inhibits the brain stem respiratory center and opposes the increased \nventilation. So, respiratory alkalosis will hinder the maximal exercise effort. (Option C). To compensate for this respiratory alkalosis, kidneys reduce hydrogen ion secretion and increase \nbicarbonate excretion. This reduces plasma and cerebrospinal fluid bicarbonate concentration and \nbrings the pH towards normal. This removes the inhibitory effect of alkalosis on respiration. \nHence the fall in blood bicarbonate facilitates the exercise effort. NOTE Lactic acid causes extreme fatigue. (Option D) Ordinarily, the pyruvic acid from glycolysis enters the mitochondria of muscle cells and reacts \nwith oxygen to form many ATP molecules. However, when there is insufficient oxygen (at high altitudes), most of the pyruvic acid then is \nconverted into lactic acid, which diffuses out of the muscle cells into the interstitial fluid and \nblood. 812 \nSold by @itachibot",

As a result, much \ndebris accumulates in the passageways, and this adds further to the difficulty in breathing. • All these factors together make even a light smoker experience respiratory strain during maximal \nexercise, and their level of performance may be reduced. • In persons with severe emphysema, as much as four-fifths of the respiratory membrane can be \ndestroyed; then, even the slightest exercise can cause respiratory distress. Chronic smoking is an \nimportant cause of emphysema.",

Regulation of respiration in exercise • During strenuous exercise, O2 consumption and CO2 for mation can increase as much as 20- \nfold. Yet in the healthy athlete, the arterial PO2, PCO2, and pH remain almost exactly \nnormal. This is because the alveolar ventilation increases along with the increased level of oxygen \nmetabolism. • Part of this stimulation of alveolar ventilation results from direct stimulation of the respiratory \ncenter by nervous signals. An additional part is believed to result from sensory signals transmitted \ninto the respiratory center from the contracting muscles and joint proprioceptors. • During strenuous exercise, the utilization of O2 in the entire body can increase to 75% to 85%. \nSo, essentially all the oxygen is given to the exercising muscles leading to an increased 811 \nSold by @itachibot arterio-venous difference in oxygen concentration.",

    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "The fall in blood bicarbonate levels is compensatory, and it helps increase the exercise effort, not \nhinder it. Adaptation at High Altitudes The work capacity is reduced at high altitudes and this reduction is in direct proportion to the \ndecrease in O2 uptake. (Option B) Immediate exposure to low PO2 at higher altitudes stimulates the arterial chemoreceptors, and \nthis stimulation increases alveolar ventilation. This immediate increase in pulmonary ventilation upon rising to a high altitude blows off large \nquantities of CO2, reducing the PCO2 and increasing the pH of the body fluids (Respiratory \nalkalosis). This raised pH inhibits the brain stem respiratory center and opposes the increased \nventilation. So, respiratory alkalosis will hinder the maximal exercise effort. (Option C). To compensate for this respiratory alkalosis, kidneys reduce hydrogen ion secretion and increase \nbicarbonate excretion. This reduces plasma and cerebrospinal fluid bicarbonate concentration and \nbrings the pH towards normal. This removes the inhibitory effect of alkalosis on respiration. \nHence the fall in blood bicarbonate facilitates the exercise effort. NOTE Lactic acid causes extreme fatigue. (Option D) Ordinarily, the pyruvic acid from glycolysis enters the mitochondria of muscle cells and reacts \nwith oxygen to form many ATP molecules. However, when there is insufficient oxygen (at high altitudes), most of the pyruvic acid then is \nconverted into lactic acid, which diffuses out of the muscle cells into the interstitial fluid and \nblood. 812 \nSold by @itachibot",

As a result, much \ndebris accumulates in the passageways, and this adds further to the difficulty in breathing. • All these factors together make even a light smoker experience respiratory strain during maximal \nexercise, and their level of performance may be reduced. • In persons with severe emphysema, as much as four-fifths of the respiratory membrane can be \ndestroyed; then, even the slightest exercise can cause respiratory distress.

This is because the alveolar ventilation increases along with the increased level of oxygen \nmetabolism. • Part of this stimulation of alveolar ventilation results from direct stimulation of the respiratory \ncenter by nervous signals. An additional part is believed to result from sensory signals transmitted \ninto the respiratory center from the contracting muscles and joint proprioceptors. • During strenuous exercise, the utilization of O2 in the entire body can increase to 75% to 85%. \nSo, essentially all the oxygen is given to the exercising muscles leading to an increased 811 \nSold by @itachibot arterio-venous difference in oxygen concentration.",

    "explanation": "The fall in blood bicarbonate levels is compensatory, and it helps increase the exercise effort, not \nhinder it. Adaptation at High Altitudes The work capacity is reduced at high altitudes and this reduction is in direct proportion to the \ndecrease in O2 uptake. (Option B) Immediate exposure to low PO2 at higher altitudes stimulates the arterial chemoreceptors, and \nthis stimulation increases alveolar ventilation. This immediate increase in pulmonary ventilation upon rising to a high altitude blows off large \nquantities of CO2, reducing the PCO2 and increasing the pH of the body fluids (Respiratory \nalkalosis). This raised pH inhibits the brain stem respiratory center and opposes the increased \nventilation. So, respiratory alkalosis will hinder the maximal exercise effort. (Option C). To compensate for this respiratory alkalosis, kidneys reduce hydrogen ion secretion and increase \nbicarbonate excretion. This reduces plasma and cerebrospinal fluid bicarbonate concentration and \nbrings the pH towards normal. This removes the inhibitory effect of alkalosis on respiration. \nHence the fall in blood bicarbonate facilitates the exercise effort. NOTE Lactic acid causes extreme fatigue. (Option D) Ordinarily, the pyruvic acid from glycolysis enters the mitochondria of muscle cells and reacts \nwith oxygen to form many ATP molecules. However, when there is insufficient oxygen (at high altitudes), most of the pyruvic acid then is \nconverted into lactic acid, which diffuses out of the muscle cells into the interstitial fluid and \nblood. 812 \nSold by @itachibot",

As a result, much \ndebris accumulates in the passageways, and this adds further to the difficulty in breathing. • All these factors together make even a light smoker experience respiratory strain during maximal \nexercise, and their level of performance may be reduced. • In persons with severe emphysema, as much as four-fifths of the respiratory membrane can be \ndestroyed; then, even the slightest exercise can cause respiratory distress.

They detect sodium \nconcentration of the fluid in the tubule (chemoreceptor). In response to elevated sodium, the \nmacula densa cells trigger the contraction of the afferent arteriole, reducing the flow of blood to \nthe glomerulus and the glomerular filtration rate. This happens as follows: When there is \nincreased sodium, there is increased sodium-potassium ATPase activity which leads to increased \nATP hydrolysis causing more adenosine formation. The adenosine receptors on the macula densa \ncells stimulate it to release more calcium, so that there is vasoconstriction of the afferent arteriole, \nthereby decreasing the GFR. • Lacis cells: Extraglomerular mesangial cells situated between afferent and efferent arteriole. • Granular cells/JG cells: Modified smooth muscle cells of the afferent arteriole, they secrete \nrenin.

    "explanation": "In the given graph, the order of filterability is A&gt;B&gt;C, which likely indicates that the \nsubstances are Polycationic, Neutral, Polyanionic. The glomerular filtration barrier is negatively charged, which will repel most of the negative \ncharged (anionic substances). Whereas, the cationic substances are easily filtered. Hence, the order of filterability would be: Polycationic &gt; Neutral &gt; Polyanionic, represented \nby A, B, and C in the graph shown. The glomerular filtration barrier consists of: 650 \nSold by @itachibot • Endothelium of the capillary • Basement membrane: • Lamina densa - electron-dense layer. It contains type IV collagen • Lamina rara interna - contains glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate which has a negative charge • Lamina rara externa - contains glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate which has a negative charge • Layer of epithelial cells (podocytes) surrounding the outer surface of the capillary basement \nmembrane The capillary endothelium is perforated by thousands of small holes called fenestrae, which \nmeasure from 4 nm up to 8nm. Therefore, neutral substances with molecular diameters of less \nthan 4 nm are freely filtered, and filtration of those with diameters of more than 8 nm approaches \nzero. However, in addition to the size of the particles, the filtration also depends mainly on the charge \nof the particle being filtered. The glomerular capillary wall consists of highly negatively charged \nproteins called sialoproteins, which repel the negatively charged substances (anions). The \nproperty can be studied by using charged dextran. When the filtration of the negatively and positively charged dextrans was studied, the results \nindicated that the negatively charged dextrans in the blood are repelled, with the result that \nfiltration of anionic substances 4 nm in diameter is less than half that of neutral substances of the \nsame size. This explains, why albumin despite having an effective molecular diameter of approximately 7 \nnm, has a very low filtration rate. 651 \nSold by @itachibot Renal Tubular Functions, Urine Concentration and Dilution",

    "explanation": "The fall in blood bicarbonate levels is compensatory, and it helps increase the exercise effort, not \nhinder it. Adaptation at High Altitudes The work capacity is reduced at high altitudes and this reduction is in direct proportion to the \ndecrease in O2 uptake. (Option B) Immediate exposure to low PO2 at higher altitudes stimulates the arterial chemoreceptors, and \nthis stimulation increases alveolar ventilation. This immediate increase in pulmonary ventilation upon rising to a high altitude blows off large \nquantities of CO2, reducing the PCO2 and increasing the pH of the body fluids (Respiratory \nalkalosis). This raised pH inhibits the brain stem respiratory center and opposes the increased \nventilation. So, respiratory alkalosis will hinder the maximal exercise effort. (Option C). To compensate for this respiratory alkalosis, kidneys reduce hydrogen ion secretion and increase \nbicarbonate excretion. This reduces plasma and cerebrospinal fluid bicarbonate concentration and \nbrings the pH towards normal. This removes the inhibitory effect of alkalosis on respiration. \nHence the fall in blood bicarbonate facilitates the exercise effort. NOTE Lactic acid causes extreme fatigue. (Option D) Ordinarily, the pyruvic acid from glycolysis enters the mitochondria of muscle cells and reacts \nwith oxygen to form many ATP molecules. However, when there is insufficient oxygen (at high altitudes), most of the pyruvic acid then is \nconverted into lactic acid, which diffuses out of the muscle cells into the interstitial fluid and \nblood. 812 \nSold by @itachibot",

    "explanation": "Exercise causes an increase in body temperature. Almost all the energy released by the body’s metabolism of nutrients is eventually converted into \nbody heat. Since metabolism rises significantly during exercise there is an increase in the body \ntemperature. This increase in body temperature is significant and even lethal conditions such as \nheatstroke can easily develop in an athlete.

That is, the mean arterial pressure can be increased to as high as 140 mm Hg \nwithout significant change in cerebral blood flow. Option B: The arterial Po2, Pco2, and pH remain almost exactly normal even though during \nstrenuous exercise, O2 consumption and CO2 formation can increase as much as 20 fold. Option C: The increase in blood flow to exercising muscles is immediate and not after 15 minutes.",

Cardiovascular Changes in Exercise • The maximum increase of cardiac output is 4-fold that can commonly be achieved by the \nuntrained runner and 7-fold that can be achieved in some marathon runners. • The increase in heart rate accounts for a greater proportion of the increase in cardiac output \nthan the increase in stroke volume during sustained strenuous exercise. • Exercise also causes an increased venous return due to • Increased activity of the respiratory pump • Increased activity of the muscular pump • Increased venous tone due to sympathetic stimulation • Increased blood flow from arteries to veins • In severe exercise, there is increased systolic and mean blood pressure due to • vasoconstriction of the arterioles and small arteries in most tissues of the body • increased pumping activity by the heart • a great increase in mean systemic filling pressure caused mainly by venous contraction. 815 \nSold by @itachibot • As seen in the figure, point A is the resting cardiac output.

The adenosine receptors on the macula densa \ncells stimulate it to release more calcium, so that there is vasoconstriction of the afferent arteriole, \nthereby decreasing the GFR. • Lacis cells: Extraglomerular mesangial cells situated between afferent and efferent arteriole. • Granular cells/JG cells: Modified smooth muscle cells of the afferent arteriole, they secrete \nrenin. Fall in pressure in afferent arteriole stimulates renin release (mechanoreceptor), which, in \nturn, increases blood pressure. 677 \nSold by @itachibot Acid-Base Balance, Renal Hormones and Micturition Reflex",

Yet in the healthy athlete, the arterial PO2, PCO2, and pH remain almost exactly \nnormal. This is because the alveolar ventilation increases along with the increased level of oxygen \nmetabolism. • Part of this stimulation of alveolar ventilation results from direct stimulation of the respiratory \ncenter by nervous signals. An additional part is believed to result from sensory signals transmitted \ninto the respiratory center from the contracting muscles and joint proprioceptors. • During strenuous exercise, the utilization of O2 in the entire body can increase to 75% to 85%. \nSo, essentially all the oxygen is given to the exercising muscles leading to an increased 811 \nSold by @itachibot arterio-venous difference in oxygen concentration.",

    "explanation": "The fall in blood bicarbonate levels is compensatory, and it helps increase the exercise effort, not \nhinder it. Adaptation at High Altitudes The work capacity is reduced at high altitudes and this reduction is in direct proportion to the \ndecrease in O2 uptake. (Option B) Immediate exposure to low PO2 at higher altitudes stimulates the arterial chemoreceptors, and \nthis stimulation increases alveolar ventilation. This immediate increase in pulmonary ventilation upon rising to a high altitude blows off large \nquantities of CO2, reducing the PCO2 and increasing the pH of the body fluids (Respiratory \nalkalosis). This raised pH inhibits the brain stem respiratory center and opposes the increased \nventilation. So, respiratory alkalosis will hinder the maximal exercise effort. (Option C). To compensate for this respiratory alkalosis, kidneys reduce hydrogen ion secretion and increase \nbicarbonate excretion. This reduces plasma and cerebrospinal fluid bicarbonate concentration and \nbrings the pH towards normal. This removes the inhibitory effect of alkalosis on respiration. \nHence the fall in blood bicarbonate facilitates the exercise effort. NOTE Lactic acid causes extreme fatigue. (Option D) Ordinarily, the pyruvic acid from glycolysis enters the mitochondria of muscle cells and reacts \nwith oxygen to form many ATP molecules. However, when there is insufficient oxygen (at high altitudes), most of the pyruvic acid then is \nconverted into lactic acid, which diffuses out of the muscle cells into the interstitial fluid and \nblood. 812 \nSold by @itachibot",

As a result, much \ndebris accumulates in the passageways, and this adds further to the difficulty in breathing. • All these factors together make even a light smoker experience respiratory strain during maximal \nexercise, and their level of performance may be reduced. • In persons with severe emphysema, as much as four-fifths of the respiratory membrane can be \ndestroyed; then, even the slightest exercise can cause respiratory distress.

Regulation of respiration in exercise • During strenuous exercise, O2 consumption and CO2 for mation can increase as much as 20- \nfold. Yet in the healthy athlete, the arterial PO2, PCO2, and pH remain almost exactly \nnormal. This is because the alveolar ventilation increases along with the increased level of oxygen \nmetabolism. • Part of this stimulation of alveolar ventilation results from direct stimulation of the respiratory \ncenter by nervous signals. An additional part is believed to result from sensory signals transmitted \ninto the respiratory center from the contracting muscles and joint proprioceptors. • During strenuous exercise, the utilization of O2 in the entire body can increase to 75% to 85%. \nSo, essentially all the oxygen is given to the exercising muscles leading to an increased 811 \nSold by @itachibot arterio-venous difference in oxygen concentration.",

    "explanation": "The fall in blood bicarbonate levels is compensatory, and it helps increase the exercise effort, not \nhinder it. Adaptation at High Altitudes The work capacity is reduced at high altitudes and this reduction is in direct proportion to the \ndecrease in O2 uptake. (Option B) Immediate exposure to low PO2 at higher altitudes stimulates the arterial chemoreceptors, and \nthis stimulation increases alveolar ventilation. This immediate increase in pulmonary ventilation upon rising to a high altitude blows off large \nquantities of CO2, reducing the PCO2 and increasing the pH of the body fluids (Respiratory \nalkalosis). This raised pH inhibits the brain stem respiratory center and opposes the increased \nventilation. So, respiratory alkalosis will hinder the maximal exercise effort. (Option C). To compensate for this respiratory alkalosis, kidneys reduce hydrogen ion secretion and increase \nbicarbonate excretion. This reduces plasma and cerebrospinal fluid bicarbonate concentration and \nbrings the pH towards normal. This removes the inhibitory effect of alkalosis on respiration. \nHence the fall in blood bicarbonate facilitates the exercise effort. NOTE Lactic acid causes extreme fatigue. (Option D) Ordinarily, the pyruvic acid from glycolysis enters the mitochondria of muscle cells and reacts \nwith oxygen to form many ATP molecules. However, when there is insufficient oxygen (at high altitudes), most of the pyruvic acid then is \nconverted into lactic acid, which diffuses out of the muscle cells into the interstitial fluid and \nblood. 812 \nSold by @itachibot",

This is because the alveolar ventilation increases along with the increased level of oxygen \nmetabolism. • Part of this stimulation of alveolar ventilation results from direct stimulation of the respiratory \ncenter by nervous signals. An additional part is believed to result from sensory signals transmitted \ninto the respiratory center from the contracting muscles and joint proprioceptors. • During strenuous exercise, the utilization of O2 in the entire body can increase to 75% to 85%. \nSo, essentially all the oxygen is given to the exercising muscles leading to an increased 811 \nSold by @itachibot arterio-venous difference in oxygen concentration.",

    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "The fall in blood bicarbonate levels is compensatory, and it helps increase the exercise effort, not \nhinder it. Adaptation at High Altitudes The work capacity is reduced at high altitudes and this reduction is in direct proportion to the \ndecrease in O2 uptake. (Option B) Immediate exposure to low PO2 at higher altitudes stimulates the arterial chemoreceptors, and \nthis stimulation increases alveolar ventilation. This immediate increase in pulmonary ventilation upon rising to a high altitude blows off large \nquantities of CO2, reducing the PCO2 and increasing the pH of the body fluids (Respiratory \nalkalosis). This raised pH inhibits the brain stem respiratory center and opposes the increased \nventilation. So, respiratory alkalosis will hinder the maximal exercise effort. (Option C). To compensate for this respiratory alkalosis, kidneys reduce hydrogen ion secretion and increase \nbicarbonate excretion. This reduces plasma and cerebrospinal fluid bicarbonate concentration and \nbrings the pH towards normal. This removes the inhibitory effect of alkalosis on respiration. \nHence the fall in blood bicarbonate facilitates the exercise effort. NOTE Lactic acid causes extreme fatigue. (Option D) Ordinarily, the pyruvic acid from glycolysis enters the mitochondria of muscle cells and reacts \nwith oxygen to form many ATP molecules. However, when there is insufficient oxygen (at high altitudes), most of the pyruvic acid then is \nconverted into lactic acid, which diffuses out of the muscle cells into the interstitial fluid and \nblood. 812 \nSold by @itachibot",

As a result, much \ndebris accumulates in the passageways, and this adds further to the difficulty in breathing. • All these factors together make even a light smoker experience respiratory strain during maximal \nexercise, and their level of performance may be reduced. • In persons with severe emphysema, as much as four-fifths of the respiratory membrane can be \ndestroyed; then, even the slightest exercise can cause respiratory distress.

Regulation of respiration in exercise • During strenuous exercise, O2 consumption and CO2 for mation can increase as much as 20- \nfold. Yet in the healthy athlete, the arterial PO2, PCO2, and pH remain almost exactly \nnormal. This is because the alveolar ventilation increases along with the increased level of oxygen \nmetabolism. • Part of this stimulation of alveolar ventilation results from direct stimulation of the respiratory \ncenter by nervous signals. An additional part is believed to result from sensory signals transmitted \ninto the respiratory center from the contracting muscles and joint proprioceptors. • During strenuous exercise, the utilization of O2 in the entire body can increase to 75% to 85%. \nSo, essentially all the oxygen is given to the exercising muscles leading to an increased 811 \nSold by @itachibot arterio-venous difference in oxygen concentration.",

    "explanation": "The fall in blood bicarbonate levels is compensatory, and it helps increase the exercise effort, not \nhinder it. Adaptation at High Altitudes The work capacity is reduced at high altitudes and this reduction is in direct proportion to the \ndecrease in O2 uptake. (Option B) Immediate exposure to low PO2 at higher altitudes stimulates the arterial chemoreceptors, and \nthis stimulation increases alveolar ventilation. This immediate increase in pulmonary ventilation upon rising to a high altitude blows off large \nquantities of CO2, reducing the PCO2 and increasing the pH of the body fluids (Respiratory \nalkalosis). This raised pH inhibits the brain stem respiratory center and opposes the increased \nventilation. So, respiratory alkalosis will hinder the maximal exercise effort. (Option C). To compensate for this respiratory alkalosis, kidneys reduce hydrogen ion secretion and increase \nbicarbonate excretion. This reduces plasma and cerebrospinal fluid bicarbonate concentration and \nbrings the pH towards normal. This removes the inhibitory effect of alkalosis on respiration. \nHence the fall in blood bicarbonate facilitates the exercise effort. NOTE Lactic acid causes extreme fatigue. (Option D) Ordinarily, the pyruvic acid from glycolysis enters the mitochondria of muscle cells and reacts \nwith oxygen to form many ATP molecules. However, when there is insufficient oxygen (at high altitudes), most of the pyruvic acid then is \nconverted into lactic acid, which diffuses out of the muscle cells into the interstitial fluid and \nblood. 812 \nSold by @itachibot",

As a result, much \ndebris accumulates in the passageways, and this adds further to the difficulty in breathing. • All these factors together make even a light smoker experience respiratory strain during maximal \nexercise, and their level of performance may be reduced. • In persons with severe emphysema, as much as four-fifths of the respiratory membrane can be \ndestroyed; then, even the slightest exercise can cause respiratory distress.

    "explanation": "The fall in blood bicarbonate levels is compensatory, and it helps increase the exercise effort, not \nhinder it. Adaptation at High Altitudes The work capacity is reduced at high altitudes and this reduction is in direct proportion to the \ndecrease in O2 uptake. (Option B) Immediate exposure to low PO2 at higher altitudes stimulates the arterial chemoreceptors, and \nthis stimulation increases alveolar ventilation. This immediate increase in pulmonary ventilation upon rising to a high altitude blows off large \nquantities of CO2, reducing the PCO2 and increasing the pH of the body fluids (Respiratory \nalkalosis). This raised pH inhibits the brain stem respiratory center and opposes the increased \nventilation. So, respiratory alkalosis will hinder the maximal exercise effort. (Option C). To compensate for this respiratory alkalosis, kidneys reduce hydrogen ion secretion and increase \nbicarbonate excretion. This reduces plasma and cerebrospinal fluid bicarbonate concentration and \nbrings the pH towards normal. This removes the inhibitory effect of alkalosis on respiration. \nHence the fall in blood bicarbonate facilitates the exercise effort. NOTE Lactic acid causes extreme fatigue. (Option D) Ordinarily, the pyruvic acid from glycolysis enters the mitochondria of muscle cells and reacts \nwith oxygen to form many ATP molecules. However, when there is insufficient oxygen (at high altitudes), most of the pyruvic acid then is \nconverted into lactic acid, which diffuses out of the muscle cells into the interstitial fluid and \nblood. 812 \nSold by @itachibot",

    "explanation": "The fall in blood bicarbonate levels is compensatory, and it helps increase the exercise effort, not \nhinder it. Adaptation at High Altitudes The work capacity is reduced at high altitudes and this reduction is in direct proportion to the \ndecrease in O2 uptake. (Option B) Immediate exposure to low PO2 at higher altitudes stimulates the arterial chemoreceptors, and \nthis stimulation increases alveolar ventilation. This immediate increase in pulmonary ventilation upon rising to a high altitude blows off large \nquantities of CO2, reducing the PCO2 and increasing the pH of the body fluids (Respiratory \nalkalosis). This raised pH inhibits the brain stem respiratory center and opposes the increased \nventilation. So, respiratory alkalosis will hinder the maximal exercise effort. (Option C). To compensate for this respiratory alkalosis, kidneys reduce hydrogen ion secretion and increase \nbicarbonate excretion. This reduces plasma and cerebrospinal fluid bicarbonate concentration and \nbrings the pH towards normal. This removes the inhibitory effect of alkalosis on respiration. \nHence the fall in blood bicarbonate facilitates the exercise effort. NOTE Lactic acid causes extreme fatigue. (Option D) Ordinarily, the pyruvic acid from glycolysis enters the mitochondria of muscle cells and reacts \nwith oxygen to form many ATP molecules. However, when there is insufficient oxygen (at high altitudes), most of the pyruvic acid then is \nconverted into lactic acid, which diffuses out of the muscle cells into the interstitial fluid and \nblood. 812 \nSold by @itachibot",

Therefore, Respiratory quotient = 200/250 = 0.8 The respiratory quotient (R•) is used for determining the metabolic utilization of various foods. • When carbohydrates are metabolized with one molecule of oxygen, one carbon dioxide molecule \nis released. Therefore, the R• of carbohydrates = 1. • When fats are oxidized, for every 100 molecules of oxygen consumed, 70 molecules of CO2 are \nreleased. Therefore, the R• of fats is 0.70. • Similarly, the respiratory quotient for proteins is 0.80. 817 \nSold by @itachibot",

    "explanation": "The fall in blood bicarbonate levels is compensatory, and it helps increase the exercise effort, not \nhinder it. Adaptation at High Altitudes The work capacity is reduced at high altitudes and this reduction is in direct proportion to the \ndecrease in O2 uptake. (Option B) Immediate exposure to low PO2 at higher altitudes stimulates the arterial chemoreceptors, and \nthis stimulation increases alveolar ventilation. This immediate increase in pulmonary ventilation upon rising to a high altitude blows off large \nquantities of CO2, reducing the PCO2 and increasing the pH of the body fluids (Respiratory \nalkalosis). This raised pH inhibits the brain stem respiratory center and opposes the increased \nventilation. So, respiratory alkalosis will hinder the maximal exercise effort. (Option C). To compensate for this respiratory alkalosis, kidneys reduce hydrogen ion secretion and increase \nbicarbonate excretion. This reduces plasma and cerebrospinal fluid bicarbonate concentration and \nbrings the pH towards normal. This removes the inhibitory effect of alkalosis on respiration. \nHence the fall in blood bicarbonate facilitates the exercise effort. NOTE Lactic acid causes extreme fatigue. (Option D) Ordinarily, the pyruvic acid from glycolysis enters the mitochondria of muscle cells and reacts \nwith oxygen to form many ATP molecules. However, when there is insufficient oxygen (at high altitudes), most of the pyruvic acid then is \nconverted into lactic acid, which diffuses out of the muscle cells into the interstitial fluid and \nblood. 812 \nSold by @itachibot",

Other factors leading to increased muscle flow include • sympathetic nervous system activation • increase in arterial pressure, and • increase in cardiac output. However, the effect of local metabolites is greater than these factors in increasing the muscle \nblood flow. Hence, the best answer is local metabolites.",

      "d": "Arterial pH falls"
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "Signals from joint proprioceptors play a role in stimulating the respiratory drive during exercise. Regulation of respiration in exercise • During strenuous exercise, O2 consumption and CO2 for mation can increase as much as 20- \nfold. Yet in the healthy athlete, the arterial PO2, PCO2, and pH remain almost exactly \nnormal. This is because the alveolar ventilation increases along with the increased level of oxygen \nmetabolism. • Part of this stimulation of alveolar ventilation results from direct stimulation of the respiratory \ncenter by nervous signals. An additional part is believed to result from sensory signals transmitted \ninto the respiratory center from the contracting muscles and joint proprioceptors. • During strenuous exercise, the utilization of O2 in the entire body can increase to 75% to 85%. \nSo, essentially all the oxygen is given to the exercising muscles leading to an increased 811 \nSold by @itachibot arterio-venous difference in oxygen concentration.",

      "c": "Respiratory alkalosis",
      "d": "High blood lactate levels"
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "The fall in blood bicarbonate levels is compensatory, and it helps increase the exercise effort, not \nhinder it. Adaptation at High Altitudes The work capacity is reduced at high altitudes and this reduction is in direct proportion to the \ndecrease in O2 uptake. (Option B) Immediate exposure to low PO2 at higher altitudes stimulates the arterial chemoreceptors, and \nthis stimulation increases alveolar ventilation. This immediate increase in pulmonary ventilation upon rising to a high altitude blows off large \nquantities of CO2, reducing the PCO2 and increasing the pH of the body fluids (Respiratory \nalkalosis). This raised pH inhibits the brain stem respiratory center and opposes the increased \nventilation. So, respiratory alkalosis will hinder the maximal exercise effort. (Option C). To compensate for this respiratory alkalosis, kidneys reduce hydrogen ion secretion and increase \nbicarbonate excretion. This reduces plasma and cerebrospinal fluid bicarbonate concentration and \nbrings the pH towards normal. This removes the inhibitory effect of alkalosis on respiration. \nHence the fall in blood bicarbonate facilitates the exercise effort. NOTE Lactic acid causes extreme fatigue. (Option D) Ordinarily, the pyruvic acid from glycolysis enters the mitochondria of muscle cells and reacts \nwith oxygen to form many ATP molecules. However, when there is insufficient oxygen (at high altitudes), most of the pyruvic acid then is \nconverted into lactic acid, which diffuses out of the muscle cells into the interstitial fluid and \nblood. 812 \nSold by @itachibot",

    "correct_answer": "d",
    "explanation": "Smoking causes no change to the sensitivity of the chemoreceptors. Effect of Smoking on Pulmonary Ventilation in Exercise • Nicotine causes constriction of the terminal bronchioles of the lungs, which increases the \nresistance of air flow into and out of the lungs. • The irritating effects of the smoke causes increased fluid secretion into the bronchial tree and \nsome degree of swelling of the epithelial linings, which again increases airflow resistance. • Nicotine paralyzes the cilia on the surfaces of the respiratory epithelial cells. As a result, much \ndebris accumulates in the passageways, and this adds further to the difficulty in breathing. • All these factors together make even a light smoker experience respiratory strain during maximal \nexercise, and their level of performance may be reduced. • In persons with severe emphysema, as much as four-fifths of the respiratory membrane can be \ndestroyed; then, even the slightest exercise can cause respiratory distress.

Cardiovascular Changes in Exercise • The maximum increase of cardiac output is 4-fold that can commonly be achieved by the \nuntrained runner and 7-fold that can be achieved in some marathon runners. • The increase in heart rate accounts for a greater proportion of the increase in cardiac output \nthan the increase in stroke volume during sustained strenuous exercise. • Exercise also causes an increased venous return due to • Increased activity of the respiratory pump • Increased activity of the muscular pump • Increased venous tone due to sympathetic stimulation • Increased blood flow from arteries to veins • In severe exercise, there is increased systolic and mean blood pressure due to • vasoconstriction of the arterioles and small arteries in most tissues of the body • increased pumping activity by the heart • a great increase in mean systemic filling pressure caused mainly by venous contraction. 815 \nSold by @itachibot • As seen in the figure, point A is the resting cardiac output.
